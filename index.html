</strong> The young Jobs graduated from his high school and joined the course at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. During the time, Jobs had no idea on what he wanted to do with his life, and he was spending all of the money his parents had saved their entire life, so he decided to drop the course after only 1 semester, mainly because he could not afford the course. <BR>The financial difficulties didn’t stop the young man’s passion, he rolled auditing classes at Reed College. Since then, he collected and returned Coke bottles just to get himself some food money, and got his weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple.obs’ first job was with Hewlett-Packard, as a summer employee. He then took a job as a technician at Atari, which was a famous video game manufacturer. He was given a job to create circuit board for the game, “Breakout”, and he collaborated with Steve Wozniak, who was later the co-founder of the Apple Company.

<li><strong>1986: Jobs founded Pixar
  </strong>An uprising year for Apple. The company hired Mike Scott from National Semiconductor to serve as CEO. Later, Jobs persuaded John Sculley, who was the CEO of Pepsi-Cola, to serve as Apple’s CEO, with a very famous question:

“Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?”

<strong>1984: Jobs introduced Macintosh
</strong> The legend of Jobs’ innovation had just started. Jobs introduced the Macintosh to the world, and it became the first commercially successful small computer with a GUI (Graphical User Interface). The Mac’s development was later taken over by Jobs.

The company went well, but the disaster was quietly planted within the heart of the founders.

<li>
<strong>1985: Jobs is fired from Apple
</strong>A turning year for Apple and Steve Jobs. Following the internal power struggle and announcement of significant layoffs due to the pessimistic sales, Sculley took off Jobs from being the head of the Macintosh division, and later Jobs was fired by his own founded company, Apple.

Nevertheless he described that the firing was the best thing happened to his life, noting that “The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.”</li>

<strong>1986: Jobs founded Pixar
</strong> Jobs purchased the The Graphics Group with the price of $10 million, which is widely known as Pixar today.

Jobs was then named as the interim chief fexecutive. After the return of the Jobs, he terminated a number of projects which he thought was useless to the company’s business.

It’s quite interesting to note that Apple’s employees were having fear to encounter the Jobs while riding the elevator that time, fearing that they might be the next batch to be fired by Jobs.

<li><strong> 2004. He diagnosed with pancreas cancer</strong> -They said every genius does not have longer life, and it appears to be true. Jobs was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his pancreas, which doctor advised him to get his affairs in order, and told him that he should expect to live no longer than 3-6 months. For him, it means to say goodbye.

Jobs announced to his employees about the diagnosis result. However, he also stated that it is rare, far less aggressive type tumor. He resisted the conventional medical intervention (chemotherapy/radiation therapy) and embraced the diet method to cure the disease. It was a successful tactic, the tumor was reported to be "apparently removed".

2004 (end): Jobs’ first medical leave
 - After the surgery, Jobs announced in his email to Apple’s employees that he would take the entire August off to take care of his health, and expects to recover from the pancreatic cancer.

Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.“.</li>
  <li><strong>2007: Jobs Introduced iPhone
</strong> -6 months after telling the George Bodenheimer of ESPN that the company’s new phone sucks, Jobs unveiled the plan of entering the mobile market with his new and revolutionary iDevice, named iPhone, which later not only dominated the U.S. market, but also changed the way people using the mobile phone, thus forcing mobile giants like Nokia to innovate at its best.</li>
    <li><strong>2009: Underwent liver transplant
</strong>On January 14, 2009, in an internal Apple memo, Jobs wrote that in the previous week he had learned that his health-related issues are more complex than he originally thought, thus announced a six-month leave until the end of June 2009 to allow him to focus on his health. Tim Cook, who had previously acted as CEO during Jobs’ absence in 2004, became acting CEO of Apple, with Jobs still involved with "major strategic decisions."
